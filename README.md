## Problem Statement

### KPIâ€™S REQUIREMENT
Wanted to analyse key indicator for our Pizza Sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specially, we want to calculate the following matric:

- Total Revenue: This is the sum of the total price of all Pizza Ordered.
- Average Order Value: This is the average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
- Total Pizza Sold: This is the sum of the quantities of all Pizzas sold.
- Total Order: This is the total number of orders placed.
- Average Pizzas Per Order: This is the average number of Pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of Pizzas sold by total number of orders.

### CHARTS REQUIREMENT
We will like to visualise various aspects of our Pizza Sales Data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

- Daily Trend for Total Orders: Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
- Hourly Trend for Total Orders: Create a line chart that illustrate the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different Pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various Pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Generate a Pie chart that represent the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help understand customer preferences for Pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
- Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Categories: Create a funnel chart that present the total number of Pizzas sold for each Pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different Pizza categories.
- Top 5 Best Selling Pizzas based on the Total number of Pizzas Sold: Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 bestselling Pizzas based on the total number of Pizzas sold. This chart will help us identify the most popular Pizza options. 
- Bottom 5 Worse Selling by Total Pizzas Sold: Create a Bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worse selling Pizzas based n the total number of Pizzas sold. This chart will enable us to identify under perfuming or less popular Pizza options.
